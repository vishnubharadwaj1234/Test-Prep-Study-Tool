# Test-Prep-Study-Tool

Made by Vishnu Bharadwaj and Shreyas Rajalingari for the Monta Vista Cross Club Hackathon 2024.

This program is made to help students study for their tests by generating test questions for the user in their desired subject and format. It uses the OpenAI GPT API and is built using the Gradio library. Students can type in the subject of the test (ex. Recursion in JAVA) and select the test format from a dropdown (ex. Multiple choice). The user is also given the option to choose a test format that isn't already given (ex. Ranking/ordering). Test questions are generated by ChatGPT and displayed on the website.

What we are working on: add a button which the user can click to get the answers for their questions.

Next steps: add a button which allows the user to generate more questions.
